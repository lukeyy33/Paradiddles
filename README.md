# Paradiddles
Luke Waugh, Software Engineer Final Year Student

Research and investigation into mobile programming development applications and implementation of a prototype Smart phone 
application to enable drummers to improve their skills/abilities.

I am creating an android Smart phone application to air drummers with their drum rudiments known as ‘Paradiddles’.
It will consist of different degrees of difficulty to work towards, increasing a drummer’s ability to keep in time and speed whilst performing.
I have played the drums for over 10 years (which is why I chose to make this app), and there are
technical rudiments called ‘Paradiddles’. For instance a Paradiddle can consist of patterns like so: (R-L-R-R L-R-L-L).

Project Aims
My main project aims are:
 To create an application which is easy to use
 To allow the drummer to learn about paradiddles and how they work
 To play paradiddles to drummers so they can hear what the pattern sounds like
 To incorporate achievements into the app after certain criteria is met
 To provide useful information about paradiddles, and the drum community in general aspects
